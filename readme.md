# **Forex Journal Web Application**
This is the code for a prototype web application for a web hosted *Forex Journal*. 

If you are a budding Forex trader, I'm sure you have heard of **Babypips**. If not, I recommend you do. They offer a brilliant and **free** guide on Forex Trading from fundamentals all the way to advanced stuff.

In all my time researching, it is the most extensive source of free knowledge I have found on the internet regarding Forex trading. They also have a brilliant community with discussions and potential trade ideas.


> ***Note however that I am in no way related to Babypips or advertising on their behalf. I am just pointing out to a resource that I found to be very helpful when I was starting out***. 

In one of the later sections, they recommend that a trader keep a Trading Journal. It is quite a hectic thing to write down all your trades on a piece of paper because of the obvious reasons i.e misplacement. Writing them down on a notepad is also not as convinient. 

I decided to develop a web application that is a little more flexible. Offering trade summaries for example noting trades for particlar days e.g you may not be aware that you are most profitable when you trade on certain days and less profitable on other days. You may also be profitable trading some currency pairs compared to others. When you note down more trades, the app will be able to give you such trade summaries that you may not be able to track by yourself effectively. 

I have finally deployed the application to the link below:
